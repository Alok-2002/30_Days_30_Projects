Welcome to the "30 Days, 30 Web Development Projects" repository! This is a personal challenge where I'll be creating a new web development project every day for the next 30 days. As a dedicated college student specializing in Internet of Things (IoT) at Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior, I'm passionate about technology and eager to explore the world of web development.

## About Me

I am a college student with a strong passion for technology, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree with a specialization in Internet of Things (IoT).
